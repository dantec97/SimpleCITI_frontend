# Secure-Investor Frontend

A modern React frontend for Secure-Investor, a secure, auditable, and user-friendly platform for managing sensitive investor documents with strong authentication, version control, and full admin oversight.

---

## Features

- **Admin User Management**
  - Admins can create investor accounts (no open registration).
  - Each user gets an InvestorProfile.
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**
  - Users are prompted to set up MFA on first login.
  - MFA setup uses QR code and TOTP (Google Authenticator, Authy, etc).
  - MFA is required for all logins after setup.
- **Secure Document Management**
  - Investors can upload documents (ID, statements, agreements, etc).
  - Each upload is versioned; previous versions are preserved.
  - Documents are stored securely in AWS S3.
  - Users can view and download current and previous versions.
- **Audit Logging**
  - All sensitive actions (login, MFA, upload, download, etc) are logged.
  - Admins can view audit logs.
- **Admin Panel**
  - Admins can view and manage users, documents, and logs.
- **Modern UI/UX**
  - Responsive, dark-themed design with blue accent.
  - Clear feedback for all actions.
  - Consistent, accessible styling across all pages.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React 18, React Router, Fetch API
- **Styling:** Custom CSS (see `src/Styles/Styles.css`)
- **Backend:** [Secure-Investor Django API](https://github.com/your-org/secure-investor-backend) (required)
- **Storage:** AWS S3 (for documents)
- **Auth:** Django Token Auth + TOTP MFA

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18+ recommended)
- npm or yarn
- Access to the Secure-Investor Django backend (running locally or remotely)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-org/secure-investor-frontend.git
   cd secure-investor-frontend
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

3. **Configure API endpoint:**
   - By default, the frontend expects the backend at `http://localhost:8000/api`.
   - To change this, edit `src/api/api.js` and update `API_BASE`.

4. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or
   yarn dev
   ```
   The app will be available at [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) (or as shown in your terminal).

## Usage

### 1. **Admin Flow**
- Log in as an admin (create via Django admin if needed).
- Use the Admin Panel to create new investor users.
- View all users, documents, and audit logs.

### 2. **Investor Flow**
- Log in with credentials provided by admin.
- On first login, set up MFA by scanning the QR code and entering a code from your authenticator app.
- Upload documents (ID, statements, etc).
- Uploading a document with the same name and type creates a new version.
- View and download current and previous versions.
- Manage MFA from the profile settings.

### 3. **Security**
- All API requests require a valid token.
- MFA is enforced for all users.
- Documents are stored in S3 with unique keys and are only accessible via presigned URLs.
- All sensitive actions are logged for audit/compliance.

## Project Structure

```
src/
  api/           # API helper functions
  components/    # React components (Login, MFA, DocumentList, Admin, etc)
  Styles/        # CSS files (main theme, login, etc)
  App.jsx        # Main app component
  main.jsx       # Entry point
```

---

## Customization

- **Branding:**  
  Update colors and logo in `src/Styles/Styles.css` and header in `App.jsx`.
- **API Endpoint:**  
  Change `API_BASE` in `src/api/api.js` if your backend is not at `localhost:8000`.
- **Document Types:**  
  Edit the options in `DocumentUpload.jsx` to add/remove document types.

---

## Security Notes

- **No open registration:** Only admins can create users.
- **MFA enforced:** Users must set up MFA before accessing documents.
- **Token Auth:** All API endpoints require a valid token.
- **S3 Storage:** Documents are encrypted at rest and only accessible via presigned URLs.
- **CORS:** Only trusted frontend origins should be allowed in backend settings.
- **No secrets in code:** All secrets and keys are managed via environment variables on the backend.

## Demo Script (for Interviews)

1. **Admin logs in and creates a new user.**
2. **User logs in, sets up MFA.**
3. **User uploads a document, then uploads a new version.**
4. **User downloads both versions.**
5. **Admin views audit logs.**
6. **User disables MFA from profile settings.**

---

## Troubleshooting

- **Cannot connect to backend:**  
  Ensure the Django API is running and CORS is configured to allow your frontend.
- **File upload/download issues:**  
  Check S3 credentials and bucket permissions on the backend.
- **MFA not working:**  
  Ensure your device time is correct and you are using the correct code from your authenticator app.
